# Javascript

# Execution Context
    -> "Everything in JavaScript happens inside an Execution Context"
    Whenever we run js program Execution Context is created
    -> Two phases 
       - Memory Creation phase - js will allocate memory to all variables and    functions. when it allocates memory to variables it stores a special value undefined. in case of function it stores whole code of the function.
    
       - Code Execution phase - Here js code will be executed line by line in a specific order.
